Let's say you have some source files under src/, other source files under, src/engine, 
and some more source files under src/audio. Also, to make it more interesting, let's assume 
that your code is a mix of C and C++ in any of these directories. Here's a very simple 
modification which handles this situation:

csrc = $(wildcard src/*.c) \
       $(wildcard src/engine/*.c) \
       $(wildcard src/audio/*.c)
ccsrc = $(wildcard src/*.cc) \
        $(wildcard src/engine/*.cc) \
        $(wildcard src/audio/*.cc)
obj = $(csrc:.c=.o) $(ccsrc:.cc=.o)

LDFLAGS = -lGL -lglut -lpng -lz -lm

mygame: $(obj)
    $(CXX) -o $@ $^ $(LDFLAGS)
