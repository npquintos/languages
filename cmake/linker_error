## undefined reference to __weirdFunction
This could mean that the library or object file that contains the definition of __weirdFunction could not be found from the 
specified libraries and object files in the CMakeLists.txt. You have to search for this definition in the libraries and
include it in the CMakeLists.txt. How?
1.  Go to the library directory and run
nm -o *.a | grep __weirdFunction
a flag of U meant it is undefined in that library.
a flag of T meant it is defined there. Include this library in CMakeLists.txt
