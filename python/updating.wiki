# Package installation using pip.
Normally, if pip executable is accessible from the terminal,

pip install <package name>

However, if pip is only available as a module (i.e. you could import it from IDLE but not invoke it directly from terminal),

python -m pip install <package name>

If you want to upgrade to latest version for a module,

python -m pip install --upgrade <module name>
