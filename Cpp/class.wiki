If you have a class ClassEnclosing where class ClassMember is a member, you should use pointer to ClassMember instead and initialize pointer in constructor using "new"

    
    class ClassEnclosing {
        int i;
        ClassMember *c;
     };
     
   ClassEnclosing::ClassEnclosing(int i): i{i}, c{new ClassMember()} {}

Removing "new" in the initialization of class member c results on it returning a ClassMember object instead of a pointer to it. Also, the use of "new" creates the object in the heap and have to be manually deleted in the destructor.

A better approach would be

        
        class ClassEnclosing {
            int i;
            ClassMember c;
        };
  
        ClassEnclosing::ClassEnclosing(int i): i{i}, c{ClassMember()} {}
        
This has the advantage of automatically deleting object c when the enclosing class gets out of scope because object c is created on the stack.
